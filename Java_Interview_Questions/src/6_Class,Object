1. What is class?

-> Class is a fundamental unit of object oriented programming. Class is a blueprint or template for a object or entity, it defines the
   structural behavior of a object.
   Class has a variable,property (data member),methods,etc.
   
   e.g Person is a class having data member String name and so on , methods walk() and so on 
       now we can make any number of objects of a class. as person p1,p2,and so on.
       
       

       
2. what is Object?

-> An Object is a entity of a class, it represents the real world entity. Each object is belongs to some class.
   Every object has state and behavior ,state of object is determined by value of properties/variables/data members and
   behavior of object is defined by the methods.
   
   e.g p1 is a Object of person class.
       then state of object is like name of person,age of person,and so on
       and behavior is like person can walk(),talk(),and so on.
