 1. What are variable in java? How they are declared and used?
 
 -> Variables are the containers used to store the data. they are declared with the data type and can be initialize with
    the data/value with matches the data type.
    
    Rules to declares name of variables
    -It should not be reserved keyword
    -It should not start with digit
    -No special character is allowed except _
    -Alpha numeric is allowed.
    -No space is allowed
    -variable name case-sensetive (num and Num both are different)
    -No limit of length for the name.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  2.Discuss the various data types available in java with examples?
  
  ->Data types are refer to the size and values that can be stored inside the variables.
  	
  	Two types of Data types 
  	1.Primitive data type and
  	2.Non-primitive(reference type)
  	
  							1.Primitive data type            		 2.Non primitive data types
  	
  											size(bytes)
  		 						   int           4 	->                    Integer        //first letter of all non primitive data type
                                   float         4	->                    Float          //must be in capital letter and 
                                   char         1/2 ->                    Character      // in complete/full word
                                   double        8 	->                    Double
                                   short         2	->                    Short
                                   byte          1 	->                    Byte
                                   boolean       1 	->                    Boolean
                                   long			 8						  Object
                                   										  Arrays
                                   										  String
                                   										  classes
                                   										
                                   										
    Primitive -> there are two concepts in primitive 
    
    1.Narrowing -> when values of big size of data type converted into small size of data type (it may data loss) then it is called narrowing
                   It is done explicitly by the programmer.
                   
      e.g  int i=0;
           float f=5.5;
           
           int a = (int) f;   (data loss = 0.5) explicitly by programmer
                   
    2.Widening ->when values of small size of data type converted into big size of data type (no data loss) then it is called as widening
    			   It is done by the compiler automatically.
    	
      e.g  float f =0;
           int i =8876;
           
           float f = i;   (no data loss) implicitly by compiler		   
    			   
    			   
    			   
    Non primitive -> there are two concepts in non-primitive
    
    1.Boxing -> when primitive type of data convert into non primitive/wrapper then it is called as boxing.
    
    e.g int num=50;
        Integer i = new Integer(num);  (primitive to non-primitive)
        
        
        
    2.Unboxing -> when non-primitive type of data converted into primitive then it is called as unboxing.
    
    e.g Integer num = new Integer(500);
    	int i = Integer.parseInt(num);  (non-primitive to primitive);
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
    	
 3. How does Java handle Unicode characters? Why is it important?
 
 ->Unicode character support All different writing systems. Unicode is important because it represents the all characters from
   different languages. so it will help to make internationalized application which will work across the world.
