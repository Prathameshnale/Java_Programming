 There are 4 main pillars of Oops concept
 1.Abstraction
 2.Encapsulation
 3.Inheritance
 4.polymorphism 
 
 
 
 1. what is Encapsulation?
 
 Binding/Integrating data members and methods in a single unit inside class called as encapsulation.
 encapsulation provides the security, data members of a class are hidden from the other class. data member of that
 class are accessible outside the class by methods of that class only.
 
 e.g -> 1. Medicine capsule, capsule binds all the medicine material inside which cannot be accessible outside.
 		2. Office bag,School bag - which hides the notes inside the bag which accessible only to the owner of that bag.
 
 
 Access modifer -> Access modifiers are used to give access control of particular data member,method or class.
 
 There are 4 access modifiers in Java
 
 	public
 	private
 	protected
 	default
 
 
 
 
 					package p
		
		
		class A
		{
			public x;    //public
			private y;   //private
			protected z; //protected
			int i;       //default
		
		}
		
		class B extends A
		{
		
		}
		
		class C
		{
		
		}
		
		
					package q
					import package p;
		
		class D extends A
		{
		
		}
		
		class E
		{
		
		}
		
		
		
		class          		 A			B			C			D			E		
		
		private(y)			yes         No          No 			NO          NO
		
		public (x)			yes			yes 		yes			yes			yes
		
		protected (z)		yes			yes			yes			yes   		No
		
		default (i)			yes			yes			yes			No  		No
