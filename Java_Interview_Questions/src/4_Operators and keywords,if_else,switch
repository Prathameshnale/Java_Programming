1. Explain different types of operators in Java with examples?

-> 1.Arithmetic Operators - addition + ,Subtraction - ,multiplication * ,division / ,modulus %
   2.Logical Operators -    logical AND && , logical OR || , logical NOT !
   3.Bitwise Operators -    bitwise AND &, bitwise OR |, bitwise NOT ~, bitwise XOR ^
   4.Comparison Operators - equal to == , not equal to != , less than < ,greater than >, less than equal to <=, greater than equal to >=
   5.Assignment Operators - assign = , add and assign +=, sub and assign -=, multiply and assign *=, division and assign /=, 
   							modulus and assign %=
   							
 
 
2.  List some important keywords in Java and their significance?

-> class						- used to declare the class
   public,private,protected 	- this are the access modifiers used to control the access to class, fields, methods 
   static 						- static is used to create class level variables and methods.
   void							- used to indicate that method does not return anything.
   final 						- used to declare constant variables,methods,class (unchangeable)
   new 							- used to create instance of classes(object)
   this                         - used to indicate current object in class
   super						- used to refer super class or parent class of current class
   if,else						- used for conditional statements
   while,for                    - used for looping
   try,catch,finally            - used for exception handling.
   
   
   
   
   
   
3. What is the purpose of the if-else statement in Java? Provide an example of its usage?

-> If-else statements are used to execute the particular lines of code based on the condition.
   It is used for decision making in java-program.
   
   e.g if we want to give a access of application to the users having age is only 18 and above 18
       then based on condition age>=18 we can make a decision that particular user is able to use or not that application.
       
       
       
4.  Explain the purpose of the switch statement in Java and provide an example?

->  switch statement allows u to select the one block of code from many blocks of code bases on the value or value of expression.

	e.g 1.	if we want to set the temperature of AC based on the atmosphere temperature then in that case firstly we use
	    if-else ladder to set the value based on the atmospheric temperature .suppose atmospheric temp. is between 40 to 45 then
	    set value =0,else if temp. between 35 to 40 then set value =1 and so on.
	    and then based on that value we switch the particular block of code which will decide the temperature of the AC.
	    
	    2.	if we want to display the dayName of week based on the dayOfWeek(from 0 to 6) then we case use the switch statement.
	    we write 7 cases for 7 values and in each case we assign dayName of that particular value.
	    
	    
	    Rules to be followed for switch statement
	    1.for case only constant values are allowed.
	    2.No duplicate case is allowed 
	    3.break statement is used to terminate the sequence of code 
	    4.default case is not mandatory ,it will execute if the case is not present of that value. we can write anywhere any cases.
