1. What is the purpose of the for loop in Java? Provide an example.

-> for loop is used to execute the set the code repeatedly . and it is recommended to use when number of iterations are fixed.


 	e.g if you want to show a message 100 times then rather than typing it you can use for loop.
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
2. What is the purpose of the while loop in Java? Provide an example.

-> while loop is used to execute the set of code repeatedly based on the boolean condition. and it is recommended to use when we 
   doesn't know the number of iterations.
   
   e.g before the new year if you want to the reverse count down from 10 to 0 second in that case we can use while loop
       condition = while(second>0)
       
       
       
       
3. What is the purpose of the do loop in Java? Provide an example.

-> do while loop is used execute the set of statements until the given condition becomes the true.
	It is same as while loop but in do while loop condition is checked after the execution of set of code.
   
   e.g if we told user that guess the number from 1 to 10 then for that game we can use do while loop
       inside do block we scan/take the input from user and if it guessed correctly based on the condition then and then only
       it will stop keep scanning otherwise it will keep taking the input from user until user not entered correct guessed number.
       
       
4. what is the difference between for and while loop in java?

->for loop is used when number of iterations is known and while loop used when number iterations and not known and while loop iterate 
  until the condition becomes false.
