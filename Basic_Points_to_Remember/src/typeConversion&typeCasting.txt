Type Conversion and type casting -      

type conversion - when conversion happens automatically by the java compiler of one data type into another data type
                    implicitly then it is type conversion. (widening)
                - smaller data type convert into bigger data type by the compiler automaticallay
                - no chance of data loss  and no explicitly need to five any sign while converting.

        e.g.  -  byte b = 12;
                 int a = b;       <- this is type conversion which is done by the compiler itself.


type casting  -  when user/we convert bigger data type into smaller data type explicitly then it is called as type casting.
                (narrowing)
              - bigger data type convert into samaller with some symball (data type name) explicitly
              - it is not safe, it may data loss while casting.

              int a = 12;
              byte b = a;       (it will give error cause compiler gives error compiler not convert bigger data type into 
                                 small data type).
            we need to do explicity type casting i.e. convert big data type into samll data type by using data type symball.

            int a = 12;
            byte b= (byte)a;    -> now it will work fine, cause we explicitly mention to cast into byte by symball (byte).
