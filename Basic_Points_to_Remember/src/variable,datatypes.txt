variable in java - variable in java are nothing but the container comes with tha data type used to store the same
                    type of data which is declared.

                e.g     int number = 10


Data types  -  1. primitive data type -  byte,short,int,long,float,double,char,boolean
               2. Reference type\non-primitive type  - array,string,object


               byte - 1 byte
               short- 2 bytes
               int  - 4 bytes
               long - 8 bytes
               float- 4 bytes 
                 e.g - float result = 88.98;    (it will show error because we try to assign double value to float)
                                                java supports double by default between float and double
                e.g - float result = 88.98f;  not it is correct  (for float value we need to explicitly define f at the end)

               double-8 bytes  (Java supports by default double between float and double)
                e.g double makrs = 78.98;

               char - 2 byte   .e.g char c = 'p';  (should be one character with single quote)
               boolean - 1 byte  (it stores only true and false  not 0 and 1 (int other lauaguage 0 and 1 supports))
               e.g boolean  flage = true;
