1. if 
2. if else
3. if else ladder
4. switch case

  syntax ->  
                switch(condition){
                    case 1: 
                        statements;
                        break;
                    case 2:
                        statements;
                        break;
                    default:
                        statements;
                }
    value of condition should be integer
    no duplicate case is allowed
    if break statement is missing then it will execute next case if present

updated version of switch in java 12 version
you can skip the word break; after each case  1. by writing code in one line with -> symball or 2. by wirting word "yield"

1. by writing code in one line -

        switch(condition){
                    case 1 -> statement;
                        
                    case 2-> statement;

                    default-> statement;
                }

                or

2. by writing "yield"
  
        switch(condition){
                    case 1: yield statement;
                        
                    case 2: yield statement;

                    default: yield statement;
                }



Loops in java 

1. for Loop  - used when we know the number of iterations
2. while Loop  - used when we don't know number of iterations
3. do while Loop  - used when we don't know number of iterations or when we want to execure the loop at list one time.
4. for each Loop  (same as for loop syntax change only)
